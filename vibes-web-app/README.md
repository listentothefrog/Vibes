# What's in this folder?

This folder contains all of the front-end code for the web version of Vibes. We are using React-Typescript as our front-end textstack.

Don't know typescript? ðŸ‘‰ https://www.typescriptlang.org

The site will be hosted to this URL ðŸ‘‰ https://www.coolvibesgg.web.app

The website will be hosted on Firebase because we are too broke to buy a Google domain ;) when Vibes gets some traction we will buy domain.

# Wanna contribute?

We would love your input, your contribution will make Vibes a great place for friends and families to connect with each other.

We are using NPM as our package manager and maybe in the future will switch to Yarn.

Make sure you are in the home directory

`cd vibes-web-app/ npm install npm start`

If some of the above commands are not working please create a github issue.

# Thanks for having a look at this folder, hope to see your username in the commits log ;)
