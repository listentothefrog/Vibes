# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vibes! From commenting on and triaging issues, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are welcome. We aim to build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem of partners, core contributors, and community.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/listentothefrog/Vibes/blob/staging/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### Ways to contribute

If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. As you gain more experience and demonstrate a commitment to this repostory, you may be granted issue management permissions in the repository.

There are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

<li>Replying and handling open issues. We get a lot of issues every day, and some of them may lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.</li>

<li>Reviewing pull requests for the docs. Reviewing documentation updates can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, click Edit at the top of most docs pages to get started with your own contribution.</li>

<li>Help people write test plans. Some pull requests sent to the main repository may lack a proper test plan. These help reviewers understand how the change was tested, and can speed up the time it takes for a contribution to be accepted.</li>

#### Our Development Process

We use GitHub issues and pull requests to keep track of bug reports and contributions from the community. All changes from engineers at Facebook will sync to GitHub through a bridge with Facebook's internal source control. Changes from the community are handled through GitHub pull requests. Once a change made on GitHub is approved, it will first be imported into Facebook's internal source control and tested against Facebook's codebase. Once merged at Facebook, the change will eventually sync back to GitHub as a single commit once it has passed Facebook's internal tests.

### Where to get help

As you work on this project, it is natural that sooner or later you may require help. If you are ever in this situation you can create a github issue and someone will help you with your issue.
